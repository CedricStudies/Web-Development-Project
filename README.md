## üßê About 

This project was developed as part of the EGC182 Internet & Web Development module.
The objective is to create a fully functional website to promote a food stall at one of the NYP canteens. The website aims to:

- Provide relevant information about the stall to customers
- Entice the customers with appealing viusals and branding
- Allow customers to buy online with a validated HTML form
- Allow customers to contact the stall

The project emphasizes fundamentals of web design such as semantic HTML, CSS layouts, responsive design for desktop (1024px width), form validation, and consistent styling across pages.
