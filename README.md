## üßê About 

This project was developed as part of the EGC182 Internet & Web Development module.
The objective is to create a fully functional website to promote a food stall at the NYP canteen. The website aims to:

- Provide information about the stall and its offerings
- Showcase food items with appealing visuals and descriptions
- Allow users to place orders via a validated HTML form
- Provide contact and registration pages for customers

The project emphasizes fundamentals of web design such as semantic HTML, CSS layouts, responsive design for desktop (1024px width), form validation, and consistent styling across pages.

## üèÅ Getting Started

- Place an order using the Order Page (form submission will echo back to a test URL).
- Register as a member using the Member Registration Page.
- Explore the food menu and promotional banners.

## üöÄ Deployment 

Since this is a static HTML/CSS project, deployment can be done via:

- GitHub Pages
